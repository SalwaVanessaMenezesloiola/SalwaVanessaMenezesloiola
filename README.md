# Silenced Voices

## 👋 Hi, I’m @SalwaVanessaMenezesloiola

### 📖 About the Project

Silenced Voices is an application designed to support and amplify accounts that have been silenced on social media platforms, particularly Instagram. This app aims to help these accounts gain visibility by leveraging active accounts to share and promote their content in a cascading manner.

### 👀 What I’m Working On

- **Developing the core functionalities** of the app, including account registration, content promotion, and user management.
- **Implementing robust backend systems** using JavaScript, Python, and JSON APIs.
- **Designing a user-friendly frontend** to enhance the user experience.

### 🌱 Technologies Used

- **JavaScript** - For backend and frontend development.
- **Python** - For any additional backend processes.
- **JSON APIs** - For data exchange between the app and external services.
- **Docker** - For containerization and deployment.

### 💞️ Collaboration

I’m looking to collaborate with other developers, especially those interested in social media, algorithms, and open-source projects. If you have ideas, feedback, or want to contribute, feel free to reach out!
